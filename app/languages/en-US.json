  "intro": "Fertility treatments are intensive treatment forms, which could affect all parts of your life. We would like to support couples during treatment in the best possible way, which is why we have developed a short screening questionnaire. The information you provide by filling in this questionnaire will help us to determine the possible emotional impact of the treatment for you. We will then be able to advise you as to whether you might benefit from additional support from a counselor (psychologist or social worker).",
